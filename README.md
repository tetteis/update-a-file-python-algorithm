# Update a file through a Python algorithm 👩‍💻

## 📝 Description

This Python script is designed to manage a list of IP addresses in a text file (`allow_list.txt`). It provides functionality to remove specific IP addresses from the list of allowed addresses.

## 🧑‍🏫 Instructions

1. **Setup**: Place the `allow_list.txt` file in the same directory as the Python script.
2. **Configuration**:
   - Modify the `import_file` variable in the script to match the name of your text file.
   - Update the `remove_list` variable with the IP addresses that need to be removed from the list.
3. **Execution**:

   - The script will read the initial contents of the file, remove the specified IP addresses, and rewrite the file with the updated list.
